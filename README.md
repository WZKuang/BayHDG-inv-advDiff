# HDG and Bayesian Framework for Inverse Problem in Pollutant Dispersion
Demos for tracing source releasing rate/virtual height change of one/multiple sources using Bayesian framework combined with HDG numerical scheme for observation model. Steady advection-diffusion equation is used as govering equation.
+ The HDG solver that returns concentration distribution is in ermark.py.
+ Different demos are demonstrated in .ipynb files.

## Requirements:
+ Jupyter-notbook.
+ Netgen/NGSolve is required to run the code. Website:ngsolve.org.
